        Immplementation: In array, it uses Doubly LinkedList inside rather than Linked List, thatâ€™s how its order is maintained.
        Has same time complexity like Hashmaps for all operations
        Keys are insertion ordered
        Performance somewhat lower than HashMap (due to the additional task of maintaining a doubly-linked list. )
