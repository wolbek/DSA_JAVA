        Definition - Adds priority to the element. Uses Minheap(Minimum number comes at beginning rest can be in any order) or Maxheap(Maximum number comes at beginning rest can be in any order).
        
        Queue follow FIFO order - Entry at rear. Removal from front.
        Priority Queue follow priority order - Entry at proper priority place. Removal from front.

        The methods of PQ are same as queue. Just their internal implementation is different now.
